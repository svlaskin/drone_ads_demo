This contains the code needed to run the transmit/receive Pi Pico + Pico Explorer + HC-12 combination.
This requires a Pi Pico connected to a Pimoroni Pico Explorer Base and UART-capable transciever module. These must have the Pimoroni Explorer libraries installed.

For this file, simply connect the Pico to the computer while holding the BOOTSEL button, then copy the file onto the Pico. Alternatively, 

1. use an IDE such as Thonny
2. connect the Pico to the comuter
3. open the main.py file in the IDE
4. make sure the IDE has identified the Pico
5. save the file onto the Pico.
